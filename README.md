# Goal:
People can use our cosmetics recommender in order to easily build a skincare routine that works best for their skin.
# Project Description:
Recommend a skincare routine to users based on skin type, liked products, disliked products, ingredients, reviews, irritants/allergens. Users will input their skin type, the products they like, the products that they have had reactions to, their irritants/allergens (optional), and keywords (ex: hydrating, drying, acne). Our recommendation engine will determine the similarities between the ingredients of the user’s liked products and the database of cosmetic products, as well as the similarities in the keywords in product descriptions, while removing the products which contain the user’s irritants or common ingredients in products that irritate them. We will use the user's skin type to find products that contain ingredients that work best for their skin type. Then, we will generate recommendations for the  skincare routine the user could use.
